# TimeTracker

## What is TimeTracker?
TimeTracker is an open-source program built in Java that allows everyone to keep track of the time spent on a task in an easy and practical way.

## What are the use case scenarios?
TimeTracker was first thought as a program to keep track of the time spent on a ticket assigned to a developer, in this way the developer has a report with all the activities so that it's easier to declare what tickets the developer completed in a certain range of time.
However, the use-case scenarios can be different:
- You can record the time spent while studying a subject and then compare the values of this month with the previous one.
- You can record the time spent on a Jira ticket so that you can easily share a report with your coworkers.
- You can record the time spent on your workouts.
- You can record the time spent for... you will tell us what :)

## What are the supported languages?
- English
- Italian

## Is it easy to use?
Yeah! It's super easy and you don't even need an internet connection to use it!
This program was primarily thought to be immediate, nobody wants to spend time setting up things just to record their activities.

## What about my privacy?
This program saves all its data locally and nothing is shared over the internet.

## What about the license?
It's completely open source, it's under GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Can I contribute to this project?
For sure! There are different ways to contribute to this project:
- If you discovered a problem you can easily open an issue.
- If you want to contribute by coding, you are completely free to open a pull request, moreover there is a clear documentation that explains every single thing but obviously whenever there is something unclear I'm 100% available to explain. Here is the link for the documentation: https://ptivoli.github.io/TimeTracker/
- If you want your language to be supported you can translate it, under the src\main\resources\ there are all the bundle properties, you can create a new one and translate everything you want. If you need help because for example you are not a developer but you want to translate this program, we can work together.

## Where is the technical documentation?
Javadoc is published through GitHub pages, here is the link: https://ptivoli.github.io/TimeTracker/

## Which operating systems are supported by TimeTracker?
Well, I personally tested this program only in Windows, for Linux and Mac some things may give problems, such as the font used but I'm not sure since I didn't test it yet if you want to test it and share the results with me it would be awesome!
